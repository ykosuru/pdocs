Business Requirements for Account Lookup (Auto Retrieve) in Wire Payments Processing
Overview
Account lookup (auto retrieve) in wire payments processing enables the automatic retrieval and validation of debtor (payer) and creditor (payee) account details to ensure accurate, secure, and compliant high-value credit transfers via Fedwire Funds Service, The Clearing House’s CHIPS, or SWIFT. This system reduces errors, enhances efficiency, and verifies account legitimacy before initiating transactions. It leverages ISO 20022 standards, adopted by Fedwire (July 14, 2025) and CHIPS (April 2024), and SWIFT’s MX messaging (CBPR+ by November 2025), replacing legacy SWIFT MT and Fedwire FAIM formats to provide structured, interoperable data for precise account lookups.
Business Requirements
1. Functional Requirements
1.1 Account Lookup Scope: Automatically retrieve and validate debtor and creditor account details (e.g., IBAN, DDA, SWIFT BIC, routing number) for wire payments, ensuring accounts are active, in good standing, and free from restrictions (e.g., ring-fenced, holds) using ISO 20022 MX messages (e.g., acmt.023 for account verification).1.2 Real-Time Auto Retrieval: Integrate with bank or payment processor APIs to fetch account details in real time, confirming debtor/creditor account validity and ownership before transaction processing via Fedwire, CHIPS, or SWIFT.1.3 Data Extraction: Use ISO 20022 fields for lookups, including:  

Debtor Details: Name, Debtor Account, Ultimate Debtor (structured postal addresses required by November 2025 per Fedwire’s hybrid/end-state rules).  
Creditor Details: Name, Creditor Account, Ultimate Creditor, Agent BIC.  
Transaction Context: End-to-End ID, Invoice Reference (e.g., via remt.001).1.4 Account Validation: Verify account status, including:  
Active and in good standing (e.g., not closed, frozen, or delinquent).  
Free from ring-fencing or holds (e.g., legal disputes, garnishments).  
Matches authorized debtor/creditor details (e.g., via micro-deposits, Plaid Auth).1.5 Multi-Account Support: Allow debtors to select from multiple accounts (e.g., checking, savings) for lookup, with validation of ownership and status for each.1.6 Error Handling: If account lookup fails (e.g., invalid account, missing data), pause the transaction, notify the debtor/creditor, and provide options to correct details or select an alternative account.1.7 Sanctions Screening Integration: Cross-reference account details with sanctions lists (e.g., OFAC SDN, Fircosoft) during lookup to prevent transactions with restricted entities.1.8 Transaction Logging: Record all lookup attempts, results, and validations, including ISO 20022 references (e.g., account IDs, transaction IDs), for audit and compliance purposes.1.9 Dashboard and Reporting: Provide a dashboard for debtors and creditors to view account lookup results, validated account details, and transaction history, with downloadable compliance reports.1.10 Notifications: Alert debtors, creditors, and administrators via email, SMS, or in-app messages about lookup outcomes (e.g., success, invalid account, or restrictions), referencing ISO 20022 transaction IDs.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
2.1 Compliance: Adhere to Fedwire and CHIPS ISO 20022 standards (effective July 14, 2025, and April 2024, respectively), SWIFT MX (CBPR+ by November 2025), OFAC, AML, FinCEN, and SEPA regulations. Retain lookup records for seven years per AML requirements.2.2 Security: Encrypt sensitive data (AES-256), tokenize account details (e.g., IBAN, DDA), and use HTTPS/OAuth for API integrations with Fedwire, CHIPS, SWIFT, and account verification services.2.3 Performance: Complete account lookups in under 500ms to support high-volume wire payments without delays.2.4 Scalability: Handle at least 10,000 lookup requests per hour, supporting large-scale B2B payments.2.5 Reliability: Achieve 99.99% uptime, with failover mechanisms for continuous lookup operations.2.6 Auditability: Log all lookup events, validations, and errors, with ISO 20022 references, for regulatory audits and compliance reporting.  
3. ISO 20022 and Messaging Standards
3.1 Message Formats: Use ISO 20022 MX messages for account lookup:  

acmt.023: Account identification and verification request to retrieve and validate account details.  
pacs.008: Credit transfer execution, containing validated debtor/creditor details.  
pacs.002: Transaction status updates, confirming lookup outcomes or errors.  
remt.001: Structured remittance data for invoice and payment context.  
camt.052/053: Account balance and status messages to verify account standing.3.2 Key Fields for Lookup: Leverage ISO 20022 fields for accurate retrieval:  
Debtor Details: Name, Debtor Account, Ultimate Debtor (structured postal addresses required by November 2025 per Fedwire’s hybrid/end-state rules).  
Creditor Details: Name, Creditor Account, Ultimate Creditor, Agent BIC.  
Transaction Data: Amount, Currency, End-to-End ID, Invoice Reference.3.3 Interoperability: Ensure compatibility with Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT MX formats, phasing out SWIFT MT (e.g., MT103, MT202) and FAIM formats post-July 14, 2025.

4. Constraints
4.1 Regulatory Compliance: Comply with Fedwire/CHIPS ISO 20022 mandates and SWIFT’s MX migration timeline. Use structured addresses post-November 2025. Perform mandatory OFAC/AML screening during lookups.4.2 Data Limitations: Avoid local file I/O or non-API network calls. Use secure databases for account and lookup data storage.4.3 Accuracy: Ensure lookups return accurate, real-time account details, validating status and restrictions to prevent errors.4.4 Authorization: Verify debtor accounts (e.g., micro-deposits, Plaid Auth) and creditor accounts (e.g., SWIFT BIC, routing number) to confirm legitimacy and ownership during lookup.4.5 Error Handling: Pause transactions for failed lookups (e.g., invalid account, restrictions), notify parties, and support corrections or alternative account selection within 1-3 days.  
5. Integration Requirements
5.1 Payment Processors: Integrate with Fedwire, CHIPS, or SWIFT for wire transfers, and Plaid or Stripe for ACH and account verification.5.2 Bank APIs: Connect to debtor and creditor banks for real-time account lookups (e.g., using acmt.023 or camt.052).5.3 Sanctions Databases: Integrate with OFAC SDN and Fircosoft for screening during lookups.5.4 APIs: Use secure APIs for account verification (acmt.023), transaction processing (pacs.008), and status updates (pacs.002).5.5 Notification Systems: Integrate with SendGrid, Twilio, or Firebase for debtor, creditor, and administrator notifications.  
6. Success Criteria
6.1 Accuracy: Achieve 100% accuracy in account lookups, ensuring valid, active accounts with no restrictions.6.2 Compliance: Pass OFAC, AML, and regulatory audits with zero violations, meeting Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT standards.6.3 Efficiency: Reduce transaction errors due to invalid accounts by >95%.6.4 User Experience: Enable debtors and creditors to resolve lookup issues within 5 minutes via the dashboard.  
This account lookup system leverages ISO 20022’s structured data to ensure secure, compliant, and efficient wire payments, validating account details while aligning with Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT standards.
