Business Requirements for Debit Authority Management in Wire Payments Processing
Overview
Debit authority management in wire payments processing ensures that debtors (payers) explicitly authorize automated withdrawals from their accounts to settle obligations to creditors (payees), maintaining compliance, security, and transparency. This system manages the lifecycle of debit authorizations, including creation, verification, storage, and revocation, for high-value credit transfers processed via Fedwire Funds Service, CHIPS, or SWIFT. It leverages ISO 20022 standards, adopted by Fedwire (July 14, 2025) and CHIPS (April 2024), and SWIFT’s MX messaging (CBPR+ by November 2025), replacing proprietary formats like Fedwire’s FAIM and SWIFT’s MT for enhanced data integrity and interoperability.
Business Requirements
1. Functional Requirements
1.1 Authorization Creation: Enable debtors to provide explicit consent for recurring or one-time wire payment drawdowns via digital mandates or signed agreements, capturing debtor details (e.g., name, account ID) and creditor details (e.g., IBAN, SWIFT BIC).1.2 Authorization Verification: Validate debtor bank accounts (e.g., via micro-deposits, Plaid Auth, or bank API) and creditor accounts (e.g., routing number, SWIFT BIC) to ensure accuracy before processing.1.3 ISO 20022 Integration: Use ISO 20022 MX messages (e.g., pain.013 for mandate initiation, pain.014 for mandate updates) to manage debit authorizations, ensuring structured data for debtor, creditor, and transaction details.1.4 Authorization Storage: Securely store authorization records (e.g., mandate ID, debtor/creditor IDs, terms, and validity period) in a database, retaining records per regulatory requirements (e.g., two years for ACH, seven years for AML).1.5 Authorization Management: Allow debtors to view, modify, or revoke authorizations via a secure portal, with real-time updates reflected in the payment system.1.6 Payment Triggering: Link authorizations to payment schedules or events (e.g., invoice due dates) using ISO 20022 fields (e.g., pacs.008 for credit transfers, remt.001 for remittance).1.7 Notification System: Notify debtors 3-7 days before drawdowns (per NACHA/SEPA) and confirm authorization status changes (e.g., creation, modification, revocation) via email, SMS, or in-app messages.1.8 Audit and Reporting: Provide a dashboard for debtors and creditors to track authorization status, payment history, and compliance reports, including ISO 20022 transaction references.1.9 Dispute Resolution: Enable debtors to dispute unauthorized drawdowns, with mechanisms to pause payments and investigate using ISO 20022 audit data.  
2. Non-Functional Requirements
2.1 Compliance: Adhere to Fedwire and CHIPS ISO 20022 standards (effective July 14, 2025, and April 2024, respectively), SWIFT MX (CBPR+ by November 2025), NACHA, SEPA, AML, and OFAC regulations. Ensure sanctions screening on debtor/creditor details.2.2 Security: Encrypt sensitive data (AES-256), tokenize account details (e.g., IBAN, DDA), and use HTTPS/OAuth for API integrations with Fedwire, CHIPS, or SWIFT.2.3 Performance: Process authorization creation and verification in under 2 seconds, supporting high-volume B2B payments.2.4 Scalability: Handle at least 5,000 authorization records per hour, with seamless updates across systems.2.5 Reliability: Achieve 99.99% uptime, with failover mechanisms for continuous operation.2.6 Auditability: Log all authorization events (creation, modification, revocation) and payment attempts, retaining records for regulatory audits (e.g., seven years for AML).  
3. ISO 20022 and Messaging Standards
3.1 Message Formats: Use ISO 20022 MX messages for debit authority management:  

pain.013: Mandate initiation request, capturing debtor consent and terms.  
pain.014: Mandate amendment or cancellation, updating authorization details.  
pacs.008: Credit transfer execution, linked to authorized mandates.  
remt.001: Structured remittance data for invoice matching.3.2 Key Fields: Leverage ISO 20022 fields for authorization and payment processing:  
Debtor/Creditor Details: Debtor Account, Creditor Account, Ultimate Debtor/Creditor (structured postal addresses required by November 2025 per Fedwire’s hybrid/end-state rules).  
Mandate Data: Mandate ID, Authorization Date, Validity Period, Payment Terms.  
Transaction Data: Amount, Currency, End-to-End ID, Invoice Reference.3.3 Interoperability: Ensure compatibility with Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT MX formats, avoiding proprietary formats (e.g., SWIFT MT101, MT103, or FAIM) post-July 14, 2025.

4. Constraints
4.1 Regulatory Compliance: Comply with Fedwire/CHIPS ISO 20022 mandates and SWIFT’s MX migration timeline. Use structured addresses post-November 2025. Ensure AML/OFAC screening on all parties.4.2 Data Limitations: Avoid local file I/O or non-API network calls. Use secure databases for storing authorization records.4.3 Authorization Validity: Enforce expiration dates or renewal requirements for mandates, per regulatory standards (e.g., SEPA mandates).4.4 Error Handling: Pause payments if authorization is invalid or revoked, notifying debtors immediately. Support retries for failed payments (e.g., after 1, 3, or 7 days).4.5 Transparency: Provide clear communication of authorization terms, schedules, and amounts, using ISO 20022’s structured fields.  
5. Integration Requirements
5.1 Payment Processors: Integrate with Fedwire, CHIPS, or SWIFT for wire transfers, and Plaid or Stripe for ACH verification.5.2 APIs: Use secure APIs for mandate management (pain.013, pain.014) and payment execution (pacs.008).5.3 Notification Systems: Integrate with SendGrid, Twilio, or Firebase for debtor notifications.  
6. Success Criteria
6.1 Compliance: Pass regulatory audits with zero violations, ensuring all authorizations meet NACHA/SEPA/SWIFT standards.6.2 Accuracy: Achieve 100% validation of debtor/creditor accounts before drawdowns.6.3 User Experience: Enable debtors to manage authorizations in under 5 minutes via the portal.6.4 Security: Prevent unauthorized drawdowns, with zero data breaches.  
This debit authority management system leverages ISO 20022’s structured data to ensure secure, compliant, and transparent wire payment processing, aligning with Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT standards.
