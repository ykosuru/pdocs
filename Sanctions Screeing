Business Requirements for Sanctions Screening (OFAC/Fircosoft) in Wire Payments Processing
Overview
Sanctions screening in wire payments processing ensures compliance with regulatory requirements by screening all parties involved in a transaction—debtor (payer), creditor (payee), and intermediaries—against sanctions lists (e.g., OFAC, UN, EU, or Fircosoft databases) to prevent illicit financial activities, such as money laundering or terrorist financing. The system handles various Fircosoft response types, including "Customer Pending," to accurately process screening outcomes. It leverages ISO 20022 standards, adopted by Fedwire Funds Service (July 14, 2025) and The Clearing House’s CHIPS (April 2024), and SWIFT’s MX messaging (CBPR+ by November 2025), replacing legacy SWIFT MT and Fedwire FAIM formats to enhance data accuracy, traceability, and compliance.
Business Requirements
1. Functional Requirements
1.1 Sanctions Screening Scope: Screen all transaction parties—debtor, creditor, ultimate debtor/creditor, and intermediaries (e.g., correspondent banks)—against OFAC Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, UN, EU, and Fircosoft databases for every wire payment.1.2 Real-Time Screening: Perform sanctions checks in real time before processing transactions via Fedwire, CHIPS, or SWIFT, using ISO 20022 MX message fields (e.g., pacs.008 for credit transfers).1.3 Data Extraction: Extract relevant ISO 20022 fields for screening, including:  

Debtor/Creditor Details: Name, Debtor Account, Creditor Account, Ultimate Debtor/Creditor (structured postal addresses required by November 2025 per Fedwire’s hybrid/end-state rules).  
Intermediary Details: Agent BIC, Correspondent Bank details.  
Transaction Data: Amount, Currency, End-to-End ID, Invoice Reference.1.4 Fuzzy Matching: Implement fuzzy matching to identify potential hits (e.g., name variations, aliases) while minimizing false positives, with configurable sensitivity thresholds.1.5 Fircosoft Response Handling: Process and act on Fircosoft screening response types:  
Positive Match: Exact or high-confidence match to a sanctioned entity, requiring immediate transaction blocking and regulatory reporting (e.g., to OFAC).  
Potential Match: Partial or fuzzy match (e.g., similar names or addresses), requiring manual review by compliance officers.  
Customer Pending: Fircosoft indicates insufficient customer data (e.g., incomplete name, address, or ID details), requiring additional information from the debtor or creditor to resolve the screening.  
Negative Match: No sanctions hit, allowing the transaction to proceed without delay.  
False Positive: Previously reviewed and cleared matches, stored to avoid redundant escalations.  
Error Response: System or data errors (e.g., incomplete Fircosoft data), triggering retries or fallback to alternative lists (e.g., OFAC SDN).1.6 Screening Rules: Flag or block transactions involving:  
Positive or potential matches, or customer pending responses from Fircosoft.  
High-risk jurisdictions or entities per AML regulations.  
Suspicious patterns (e.g., large transfers to new creditors).1.7 Escalation Workflow: For potential matches, customer pending responses, or errors, pause transactions, alert compliance officers, and initiate manual review. For customer pending responses, prompt debtors/creditors for additional data (e.g., ID documents, address proof), allowing approval, rejection, or escalation to regulators. Positive matches are automatically blocked with audit logging.1.8 Transaction Logging: Record all screening events, Fircosoft response types (including customer pending details), hits, and resolutions, including ISO 20022 transaction references, for audit and compliance purposes.1.9 Dashboard and Reporting: Provide a compliance dashboard to monitor screening results, manage Fircosoft response types (e.g., customer pending requests), review flagged transactions, and generate regulatory reports (e.g., Suspicious Activity Reports).1.10 Notifications: Alert debtors, creditors, and compliance officers via email, SMS, or in-app messages about flagged transactions, Fircosoft response details (e.g., customer pending with required data), or screening outcomes, referencing ISO 20022 transaction IDs.1.11 List Updates: Automatically update sanctions lists (e.g., OFAC SDN, Fircosoft) daily or in real time via API to ensure compliance with the latest regulatory data.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
2.1 Compliance: Adhere to Fedwire and CHIPS ISO 20022 standards (effective July 14, 2025, and April 2024, respectively), SWIFT MX (CBPR+ by November 2025), OFAC, AML, FinCEN, and SEPA regulations. Retain screening records for seven years per AML requirements.2.2 Security: Encrypt sensitive data (AES-256), tokenize account details (e.g., IBAN, DDA), and use HTTPS/OAuth for API integrations with Fedwire, CHIPS, SWIFT, and Fircosoft.2.3 Performance: Complete sanctions screening, including Fircosoft response processing, in under 500ms to support high-volume wire payments without delays.2.4 Scalability: Handle at least 10,000 screening requests per hour, supporting large-scale B2B payments.2.5 Reliability: Achieve 99.99% uptime, with failover mechanisms for continuous screening operations.2.6 Auditability: Log all screening events, Fircosoft response types (including customer pending details), hits, and resolutions, with ISO 20022 references, for regulatory audits and compliance reporting.  
3. ISO 20022 and Messaging Standards
3.1 Message Formats: Use ISO 20022 MX messages for sanctions screening:  

pacs.008: Credit transfer execution, containing debtor/creditor and transaction data for screening.  
pacs.002: Transaction status updates, confirming screening outcomes or rejections.  
camt.056: Payment cancellation requests for transactions blocked due to sanctions hits.  
remt.001: Structured remittance data for invoice and payment context.3.2 Key Fields for Screening: Leverage ISO 20022 fields for accurate checks:  
Debtor/Creditor Details: Name, Debtor Account, Creditor Account, Ultimate Debtor/Creditor (structured postal addresses required by November 2025 per Fedwire’s hybrid/end-state rules).  
Intermediary Details: Agent BIC, Correspondent Bank details for cross-border screening.  
Transaction Data: Amount, Currency, Transaction Date, End-to-End ID, Invoice Reference.3.3 Interoperability: Ensure compatibility with Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT MX formats, phasing out SWIFT MT (e.g., MT103, MT202) and FAIM formats post-July 14, 2025.

4. Constraints
4.1 Regulatory Compliance: Comply with Fedwire/CHIPS ISO 20022 mandates and SWIFT’s MX migration timeline. Use structured addresses post-November 2025. Ensure mandatory OFAC/AML screening for all parties.4.2 Data Limitations: Avoid local file I/O or non-API network calls. Use secure databases for transaction and screening data storage.4.3 Accuracy: Minimize false positives (<1%) to avoid delaying legitimate transactions, with tunable fuzzy matching for Fircosoft responses, including customer pending cases.4.4 Authorization: Verify debtor accounts (e.g., micro-deposits, Plaid Auth) and creditor accounts (e.g., SWIFT BIC, routing number) to ensure legitimacy before screening.4.5 Error Handling: Automatically block transactions with positive Fircosoft matches, pause potential matches or customer pending responses for review, and support resolution workflows within 1-3 days. For customer pending responses, collect and submit additional data to Fircosoft. Retry error responses or fallback to alternative lists.  
5. Integration Requirements
5.1 Payment Processors: Integrate with Fedwire, CHIPS, or SWIFT for wire transfers, and Plaid or Stripe for ACH verification.5.2 Sanctions Databases: Connect to OFAC SDN, UN, EU, and Fircosoft lists via APIs for real-time updates and screening, supporting all Fircosoft response types, including customer pending.5.3 APIs: Use secure APIs for transaction processing (pacs.008), status updates (pacs.002), and cancellations (camt.056).5.4 Notification Systems: Integrate with SendGrid, Twilio, or Firebase for debtor, creditor, and compliance officer notifications, including customer pending data requests.  
6. Success Criteria
6.1 Compliance: Pass OFAC, AML, and regulatory audits with zero violations, meeting Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT standards.6.2 Accuracy: Achieve >99% accuracy in sanctions screening, with <1% false positives across Fircosoft response types, including customer pending.6.3 **Fraud Prevention**: Block >95% of transactions involving sanctioned entities.6.4 User Experience: Enable compliance officers to resolve flagged transactions and customer pending responses within 5 minutes via the dashboard.  
This sanctions screening system leverages ISO 20022’s structured data and Fircosoft’s response types, including customer pending, to ensure secure, compliant, and efficient wire payments, preventing illicit transactions while aligning with Fedwire, CHIPS, and SWIFT standards.
